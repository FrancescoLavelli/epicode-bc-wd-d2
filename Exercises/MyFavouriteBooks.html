            My passion for reading began at a school desk, sparked by the
            timeless adventure of *Ivanhoe* by Sir Walter Scott. As I turned the
            pages of this classic tale of knights, chivalry, and daring quests,
            I was transported to a world far beyond the confines of the
            classroom. The vivid characters, rich historical setting, and
            thrilling plot captivated my imagination, making me realize the
            power of books to open doors to new worlds and perspectives. That
            first encounter with *Ivanhoe* ignited a lifelong love for reading,
            as I discovered the joy of losing myself in stories, exploring
            different eras, and connecting with the emotions and ideas of
            characters. From that moment on, books became my companions,
            teachers, and endless sources of inspiration.
